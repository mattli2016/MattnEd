MattnEd
=======

Experimental Android project to learn about Android and version control

Instructions for using Git:
  - Copy the HTTPS clone URL at: https://github.com/EdwardGong/MattnEd
    - Make sure this is actually HTTPS. Might default to SSH
  - "git clone <paste>" in workspace
  - MattnEd will appear as a directory whose parent is workspace
  - To get changes (made by me or other team members?)
    - git pull
  - To make changes and push to remote repository (server storing our shared code)
    1. Make changes to any of the files under MattnEd
    2. git status (to see what changed)
    3. git diff path/to/file (to see changes, with respect to most recent code on repo
    4. git add path/to/file (changes that you want to update to the server)
    5. Make sure everything works. Install the app and test your changes.
    6. git commit -m "Commit message. This should describe your change"
    7. git push

    Steps 2 and 3 are optional, but very useful.
    You can see a log of all the commits made by you and other by typing "git log" in any subdirectory of the repo.
