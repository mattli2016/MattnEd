MattnEd
=======

Experimental Android project to learn about Android and version control

Instructions for using Git:
  - Copy the HTTPS clone URL at: https://github.com/EdwardGong/MattnEd
    - Make sure this is actually HTTPS. Might default to SSH
  - "git clone <paste>" in workspace
  - MattnEd will appear as a directory whose parent is workspace
  - To get changes (made by me or other team members?)
    - git pull
